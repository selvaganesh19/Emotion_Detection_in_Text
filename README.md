# Emotion_Detection_in_Text 😃📄

Emotion_Detection_in_Text is an intelligent system for detecting emotions in textual data. It leverages machine learning and natural language processing to analyze input text and identify underlying emotions, making it useful for applications in sentiment analysis, chatbot development, social media monitoring, and more.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

This project provides a full-stack solution for emotion detection from text, combining a Python backend powered by state-of-the-art NLP models (via Hugging Face Transformers) and an interactive frontend with PWA (Progressive Web App) capabilities. It supports multilingual inputs and offers a seamless user experience for both desktop and mobile platforms.

## ✨ Features

- **State-of-the-art NLP Model:** Uses pre-trained models for accurate emotion and sentiment detection.
- **Multilingual Support:** Automatically detects language and translates text for analysis.
- **Gradio Interface:** Interactive backend powered by Gradio for easy API integration.
- **PWA Frontend:** Installable web app with offline support via service workers.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.

## 📋 Usage

1. **Start the backend server**:
   - The Gradio interface will be available at `http://localhost:7860`.

2. **Access the frontend**:
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

3. **Enter text**:
   - Type or paste any text into the input box.
   - The system will automatically detect the language, translate if necessary, and display the detected emotion.

4. **Install as PWA**:
   - On supported browsers, you can install the app to your device for offline usage.
