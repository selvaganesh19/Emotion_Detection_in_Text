# 😊 Emotion Detection in Text using Machine Learning 🤖

Welcome to the **Emotion Detection in Text** project!  
This repository focuses on identifying human emotions (like happiness, anger, sadness, etc.) from input text using Machine Learning models. 📚🧠

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Text-based emotion detection is a valuable tool in various applications such as:
- 🌐 Social media monitoring
- 💬 Chatbot sentiment understanding
- 🎓 Educational feedback analysis
- 🛍️ Customer review analysis

This project uses supervised ML techniques to train a model on labeled text-emotion datasets to predict emotions effectively.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing** 🔧  
   Text is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized using TF-IDF.

2. **Model Training** 📊  
   Multiple models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM) are trained and evaluated.

3. **Prediction** 🔮  
   Given a new text input, the best-performing model predicts the underlying emotion.

Input: "I'm so happy with the results!"
Output: Emotion - Joy 😄
📊 Results
Accuracy: 87%+ on test data

Models tested: Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB, Linear SVM

Best performance: SVM with TF-IDF features

💡 Future Enhancements
